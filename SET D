Reverse Coding Challenge — Mixed Binary & Arithmetic
Sample Pairs
Input: 5  → Output: 20  
Input: 7  → Output: 28  
Input: 8  → Output: 6  
Input: 10 → Output: 40  
Input: 12 → Output: 5
Task: The rule involves binary representation combined with arithmetic.
hint: Look at 8 and 12 carefully — they’re the traps.
